📈 VIX Alpha Strategy – Volatility-Driven Market Signal

> A simplified demonstration of a US equity trading strategy triggered by volatility (VIX) levels.  
> *This version is public-safe and intended for showcasing quantitative logic and workflow clarity.*

## 💡 Strategy Concept

This project implements a volatility-based entry signal for U.S. equities. The approach uses the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) to identify potential regime shifts and market opportunities.

- 📊 **Trigger Condition:** When VIX exceeds a threshold, observe specific equities for potential entries.
- 🧠 **Decision Support:** Integrated with historical data to simulate entry/exit signals.
- 🔁 **Reusable Template:** Ready to adapt into a more complex alpha engine or pipeline system.
